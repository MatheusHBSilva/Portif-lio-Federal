        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Matheus Henrique Barros da Silva, I'm 20 years old, and I was born and raised in Recife.</p>
        <p>Despite being from Recife, I don't like most of the typical regional dishes or the festivals (like São João).</p>
        <p>I enjoy watching movies and anime, as well as playing games.</p> 
        <p>In this portfolio, you'll find some things I do or have done.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Education:</h2>
        <p>I completed my elementary education at Colégio Visão.</p>
        <p>For high school, I joined IFPE in the integrated technical course in electrical engineering, which I started in 2018 and finished in 2023 due to the internship period.</p>
        <p>In addition to high school at IFPE, I took an English course at Wizard, which lasted for 140 hours.</p>
        <p>Within IFPE itself, I took some additional courses to enhance my resume. During the eighth semester, I took an online course with WEG from Santa Catarina, focusing on motors and their different types.</p>
        <p>During the SNCT (National Week of Science and Technology) organized by IFPE, I had introductory Python classes taught by teachers from CMR (Recife Military School).</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
        <p>My hobbies are quite diverse, but they all share some similarities. I've always enjoyed playing video games, and since 2018 (when I bought my PS4), I've been playing a variety of games from different genres.</p>
        <p>I like to collect the games I enjoy, so I currently have 85 games on Steam and around 40 other games on PS4.</p>
        <p>I'm a big fan of the Persona franchise and I own all the games released on various platforms (this site is a parody of Persona 5 Royal).</p>
        <p>I watch CBLOL (Brazilian League of Legends Championship) and support paiN Gaming. Currently, they are the only team I truly root for and follow in all sports and e-sports. PS: I don't play League of Legends.</p>
        <p>Because of this, in my free time, I sometimes play around with Unity, trying to develop a playable game.</p>
        <p>So far, all my attempts to create something in Unity have resulted in unfinished and funny projects, but I'm finally working on a horror game (something I've always wanted, as I love the genre) that I hope to release someday.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy watching anime. I don't watch as many as I used to, but every now and then, I take the time to watch one or two episodes.</p>
